# How to compile
To compile and run the application you need Android Studio. A personal android
phone is the best but a virtual device can be used instead.

# How to contribute
Things I'd like to do in the future but you can add them as well.
- Important: The score isn't saved when leaving the application and after rotation.
- Horizontal orientation layout needs to be fixed
- Style the buttons
- A setting for games less or greater than 25
